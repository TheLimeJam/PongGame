# Pong Game

## Introduction
 I am making a 'Pong' inspired game in Unreal Engine 5. 
 To give myself a starting point I'm using this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vi4tBmv1Mhg by 'Unreal University' on YouTube and outside of some different function/variable names, a different file structure and the beginnings of some extra features what I have currently is nearly identical to the tutorial.
 The purpose of this project is to familiarise myself with Unreal and improve my knowledge of both blueprints and C++.
 
 Keeping that in mind while I will be adding new features to make this project more my own, a lot of changes will make have little to know influence on the gameplay but instead provide good learning experience.
 
 ### This will include:
 - Teaching myself better development/programming conventions and practices and updating the project to suit
 - Porting (That is definitely not the right word oh well) some blueprints over to C++
 - Changes to improve game performance


### Some features I do intent to add include
- Multiple bot player modes
- Game controller support
- Local 2 player
- High score tracker and local accounts to assign scores to
- 1 - 2 in game abilities to add more variety and complexity to gameplay
